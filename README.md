# Job-Interview-model
This model works on a raw dataset from kaggle that has questions and answer keys for various core computer science subjects in a technical interview round. The answers given by the user is evaluated based on the already stored answer keys and finally a feedback is given on how the answer has been graded and how it can be improved.
